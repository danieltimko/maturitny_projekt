# maturitny_projekt
<b>By: Daniel Timko</b>

This program is an implementation of algorithm solving following problem:

<i>Find such an assignment of root classrooms to classes in school, so that all students walk altogether as little as possible. Root classroom is the classroom, where students of that class return for breaks.</i>

Implemented algorithm uses dynamic programming and runs in O(2^N) time, where N is the number of classrooms.

I used this program as my high school graduation project.

# How to run
Input: graph of school in graph.json and schedules of classes in schedules.json

Output: best assignment printed in out.txt

To run the program, pull or download this git repository, modify the input to your needs and execute maturitny_projekt.exe. In order to do that, you have to have gcc compiler installed. You'll find output in out.txt.
